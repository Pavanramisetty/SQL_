/* 1) Create a view called emps_vu that hides some columns in the employees
    table. It must display employee number, last name, job, and department 
    number. Give the columns the following aliases: empno, lname, job, and deptno.
*/

 
-- 2) Confirm the view works by selecting from it.
 
    
 
/* 3) Query the emps_vu so that it gives you a count of employees for each deptno.
      Order the result by deptno. */
     
     
/* 4) Create a view called four_dept_vu that shows employee id, first name, last name,
      email,phone number, hire date, salary, and  manager id from the employees 
      table only for departments 30, 50, 60, and 80. Also display the department name,
      and the city where the department is located.  */
