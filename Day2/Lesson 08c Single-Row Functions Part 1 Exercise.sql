/*Look through Lesson 07b Single-Row Functions Part 1.sql and run the code examples there, then
   practice single-row functions with the excercises below:
*/

/* 1) Display the first_name, last_name, and the first four letters of 
      the first name with the last four letters of the last name of 
      each employee in department 50. Label the column SHORT_NAME. */

      4.8125% for each employee. Round the result two places past the decimal 
      and label the column NEW_PAY. */

      new salary. Label the column PAY_INCREASE. */



/* 4) Display the last name, length of the last name, for any employee
      whose last name begins with A, J, or M. Give each column an appropriate

/* 8) Display the last_name, and the number of weeks each employee has worked
      in department 90. Label the column TENURE. Trunc the number of weeks

/* 9) Show the characters in the street address in the locations table beginning
      with the character after the first space. For example, if the address is

/* 10) Display last name, the date of their first performance review, and the
