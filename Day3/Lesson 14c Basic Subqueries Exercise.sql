/*Look through Lesson 14b Basic Subqueries.sql and run the code examples there, then
   practice Subqueries with the excercises below:

--Practice Writing Subqueries


/* 1) Write a query that prompts the user for an employee last name, and then 
      displays the last name, hire date, and department id for any employee in the same
      department, excluding the given employee.
      */
          
/* 2) Create a report that displays employee number, last name, and salary for
      all employees who earn more than the average salary. Sort the results
      by salary. */

      

/* 3) Show the employee number, first and last names, salary, and department id,
      of anybody whose salary is below the company average, and who works in a 
      department with a department name that ends with s. Sort the result
      by department id and employee id. */
      
        
		

/* 4) Display the id, first name, last name, and department id of all employees 
      working in Seattle. Use subqueries rather than joins to acheive the results.*/

    
  
  
  
/* 5) Modify your previous answer to prompt the user to enter a city. Why might 
      some cities result in no rows of output? */ 
      
      
	  
	  
    
/* 6) Recreate the result of question 4, but use joins to acheive your results.*/ 
      
    


	
      
/* 7) Create a report showing the last name, job id, salary, and manager_id of every
      employee who reports to the manager whose job is AD_PRES. */     
     
      
	  
	  
	  
      
/* 8) Display the employee number, last name, job, salary, and department id of all employees
      that work in the Executive department. Do not use a join to create your
      output.*/
      
         
		 
		 
		 
		 
  
/* 9) Show last_name, salary, and department id for employees who earn more than any 
      employee in department 60, but who do not work in department 60.*/
      
         
		 
		 
		 
      
            
/* 10)  From the sales table, show every customer id, and the total amount sold
        to the customer. Name the second column sales_total. Include only customers 
        whose email ends in .co or .com. Sort the result by customer id.  
        Use a subquery for your solution. */
