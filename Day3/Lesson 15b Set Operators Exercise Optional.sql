		who work as ST_CLERK. Use a set operator to create this report. */
		
		
      
      

/* 2) Create a report showing countries that have no departments located in them. 
      Display the country id and the name. Use a set operator and join to create 
      the result.*/

      
	  
	  

/* 3) Show all consultants and employees in department 80. List their ids, first name, 
      and last name. Order the result by the id. Allow any duplicate rows to appear

/* 4) Display any employee who is working at the same job as when they were 
      first hired. That is, they changed jobs, but have gone back to doing 
      their original job. Show employee id and job id.*/
